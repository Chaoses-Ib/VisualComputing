[What are the differences between computer vision and image processing?](https://www.researchgate.net/post/What-are-the-differences-between-computer-vision-and-image-processing)

In **image processing**, an image is "processed", that is, transformations are applied to an input image and an output image is returned. The transformations can e.g. be "smoothing", "sharpening", "contrasting" and "stretching". The transformation used depends on the context and issue to be solved.

In **computer vision**, an image or a video is taken as input, and the goal is to understand (including being able to infer something about it) the image and its contents. Computer vision uses image processing algorithms to solve some of its tasks.
