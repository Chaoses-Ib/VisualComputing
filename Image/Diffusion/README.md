> UniPC is meant to work at low and very low steps numbers, 5-10.

10 steps 仍然不太够，15 steps 足够了。

bh1 vs bh2:
> The difference is small, some areas look better, some look worse, many look the pretty much the same. In general bh2 appears to do better with straight lines, bh1 looks more detailed but also tends to insert random junk into the image? I think I prefer the look of bh2.
