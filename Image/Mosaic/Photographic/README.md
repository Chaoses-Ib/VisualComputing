# Photographic Mosaic
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_mosaic)

In the field of photographic imaging, a **photographic mosaic**, also known under the term **Photomosaic**, is a picture that has been divided into (usually equal sized) tiled sections, each of which is replaced with another photograph that matches the target photo.

第一幅 Photomosaic 是由 Joseph Francis 在 1993 年制作的：
